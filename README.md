Overview

In the healthcare industry, timely and accurate predictions of patient health outcomes are essential for improving patient care, optimizing resource management, and supporting clinical decision-making. This project aims to develop a predictive analytics system that processes healthcare data to predict patient risks, identify trends, and assist in decision-making.

Objectives

Accurate Patient Risk Prediction: Predict patient risks based on various health metrics (e.g., age, medical history, test results).

Trend Identification: Discover trends that can inform preventive measures and personalized treatment plans.

Decision Support System: Provide insights to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

Resource Optimization: Improve resource allocation by identifying high-risk patients requiring immediate attention.

Scalability & Deployment: Build a scalable system that integrates new data sources and models.

Scope

Data Collection: Gathering structured healthcare data including demographics, medical history, tests, and treatments.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Identifying trends, correlations, and key features influencing outcomes.

Model Development: Training and optimizing various machine learning models.

Deployment: Deploying the model as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Monitoring & Maintenance: Ensuring model accuracy and retraining with updated data.

Installation
